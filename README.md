### Why?
WC3MapTranslator is a module to convert a JSON representation of WarCraft III (.w3x) data to their `war3map` files. This module was created for use by Ice Sickle, the new-gen WC3 world editor. You are welcome to use this module for other projects.

*But still... why?* - You may wish to familiarize yourself with the Ice Sickle project. JSON is much easier for humans to read, compared to the byte format used by WC3 files. Of course, this does come with a trade-off: increased file size. But with increased storage today and cloud-hosting, this is no problem.
